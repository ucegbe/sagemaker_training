# LightGBM Training

There are two notebooks:
1. **sagemaker-lightgbm-distributed-training-dask-Classification**: Walks through using LighGBM on SageMaker for distributed training and hyperparameter tuning for ML classification usecase
2. **sagemaker-lightgbm-distributed-training-dask-Regression**: Walks through using LightGBM on SageMaker for distributed Regression model training and hyperparameter tuning

**model_cat** contains all the dependencies and training logic for the Classification model training
**model_reg** contains all the dependencies and training logic for Regression model training
